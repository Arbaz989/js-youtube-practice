// ðŸ’¾ Primitive Data Types Primitive data types are stored directly in memory, meaning they hold their own value.
//  Examples of primitive data types include numbers, strings, booleans, and null.


// ðŸ”— Non-Primitive Data Types Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, store a reference to the value rather than the value itself.
//  This means that changes made to a non-primitive data type will affect all references to that value. 
// Examples of non-primitive data types include objects, arrays, and functions. 

// ðŸ“š Memory Allocation Primitive data types are stored in the stack memory, which is faster and more efficient than the heap memory.
//  Non-primitive data types are stored in the heap memory, which is slower but can store larger amounts of dat



// Reference Non Primitive
// Arrays,Objects and functions ///They are called functions and function specifically called object function
